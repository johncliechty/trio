  "system already has. Non-goals: the WAL inversion (deferred), multi-user/multi-tenant on one instance, " +

  "Zero-friction token: the author and each collaborator never manually find or type a token — auto-provisioned + persisted locally at onboard, auto-used by the local browser, survives restarts.",
  "No-leak distribution: the only share channel is a scrubbed bundle containing none of the author's personal/proprietary files or git history; import anchor_gui inside the staged bundle boots (smoke-gated).",
  "Works-on-arrival cross-platform: a collaborator on Windows and macOS/Linux goes bundle -> onboard -> live dashboard via one documented path; missing prerequisites surface as one upfront actionable message.",
  "Identical agent behavior: trio + foundry skills run under the same governance — 10-min status format, skills read-only/foundry-only-edit, driver-init self-configures to the host's engines.",
  "No durability regression: the durability cluster (CLI+secondary atomic writes, cross-process lock, torn-index rebuild-from-pointers, boot-reaper owner-set) is closed and covered; existing telemetry/narration/reaper-safety invariants hold.",
  "Money-safe + clean: the test suite cannot spend real money without explicit opt-in (fail-closed); shipped tree free of dev debris and dependency-doc contradictions.",
