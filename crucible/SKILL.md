# Crucible

Crucible is the **planning brain** of John's skill trio: **researchPrime** (research)
→ **Crucible** (planning) → **Foreman** (build). It is a deliberately-invoked,
heavyweight planner that turns an intent — or a messy existing project — into a
**vetted, gold-standard, Foreman-ready implementation plan**, while **never
drifting** from the project's locked objective.

> **Tier definition (Heavy vs regular · always-cross-model · seat mapping):** canonical in `C:\dev\Skill Foundry\AGENTS.md` → "Skill tiers". A `-Heavy` run uses top-frontier models on EVERY seat regardless of the base session (delegate the frontier seat to a frontier-pinned sub-agent if the base session isn't frontier); foundry skills are ALWAYS true cross-model. Do not re-define tiers locally.

> **Status (2026-06-05): the engine is built and GREEN through Wave 11.** The
> three-stage pipeline, the Shark-Tank round engine, the Synthesizer + Judge, the
> two-gate convergence, researchPrime integration, the cross-model Enhanced mode +
> GitHub remote, the docs/VC layer, and the dogfood self-run + 5-gate
> productionization checklist all live in `bin/` and are exercised by
> `node --test test/`. The model-driven steps run through an injected `agent()`
> seam; the machine well-formedness gate is Foreman's real `locate-plan.mjs`,
> SPAWNED (never forked) so its exit code is forge-proof.

## What Crucible is / is NOT

- **Is:** a standalone skill that forges a plan through framing, brainstorming, and
  **Shark-Tank** refinement steered by a persistent **Deep-Think Synthesizer** and
  backed by researchPrime, then hands a Foreman-ready plan to the builder.
- **Reuses, never forks:** imports Foreman's `foreman-lib.mjs` (atomic checkpoints,
  budget, contract primitives), `git-hygiene.mjs`, and `makeAgentDriver` from
  `wave-workflow.js`; **spawns** `foreman/bin/locate-plan.mjs` as the well-formedness
  gate. Exactly one copy of each on disk.
- **Is NOT:** a lightweight everyday planner (that's Project-Manager), a code builder
  (that's Foreman), or an infinite-polishing machine.

## Two guiding principles

- **The inclusion test (the size rule):** every element must serve a North-Star
  criterion; growth that serves the objective is welcome — only non-serving bloat is
  cut or Grasscatched.
- **The Parable of the Oranges (real-intent foresight):** probe for the real goal,
  bring expertise, think 2–3 steps ahead, add justified value, show the receipt.

## The pipeline — three you-approve stages

1. **Stage 0 — Intake & Framing** → 🚦 the user **locks the North Star**. It opens with
   a **complexity triage** (`assessComplexity`): cheap intake signals (scope, novelty,
   stakes/irreversibility, unknowns) recommend a pipeline depth — **LITE** (single-pass,
   minimal/no Shark rounds for small/clear work), **FULL** (the full 3-stage + Shark-Tank
   machinery — the default), or **SPIKE-FIRST** (probe before planning when genuinely
   uncertain). Right-sizing is **your** judgment, so it **HALTs for you to confirm** and
   **defaults to FULL** when uncertain or when stakes are high — rigor is never silently
   downgraded. The triage only right-sizes *ceremony*: the North-Star lock, post-lock drift
   detection, the inclusion test, and full Shark-Tank rigor (when FULL) are unchanged in
   every band. Then greenfield Oranges framing, or a tiered brownfield ingest (T1
   inventory/dedupe → T2 reproduce-first + coverage → T3 delegate deep archaeology to
   researchPrime), with Confirmed/Inferred/Gap labels that gate. Drift detection begins
   **after** the lock.
2. **Stage 1 — Master Plan** → 🚦 the user **approves**. Oranges brainstorm
   (assumption-map → premortem → ideate), batch triage, a phased plan, then the
   Shark-Tank loop to convergence.
3. **Stage 2 — Implementation Plan** → 🚦 the user **approves** → the well-formedness
   gate → **Foreman handoff**. Wave decomposition with per-wave acceptance criteria
   (a one-line *done-when* + Given/When/Then for non-trivial waves), the Shark-Tank
   loop, then the emitted doc-trio + `foreman.config.json`.

**The Shark Tank** is the adversarial review round: 3 independent fresh-context Sharks
(Skeptic / Contrarian / Analyst), each prompted to refute, each embedding the North
Star + a rotated PM critique angle. **BLOCKER = ≥2 Sharks agree.** **The Synthesizer**
is a persistent Director that steers but never decides; **the Judge** decides
(cross-model when reachable, else a same-model fresh-context judge persona), and **the
user is the final convergence authority**.

## Substrate (two modes)

- **Default (subscription-only):** fresh-context Sharks + a same-model fresh-context
  Judge persona. Fully functional on the bare subscription.
- **Enhanced (API keys / CLIs present):** a cross-model Judge at the lock gate + a
  reasoning Synthesizer, selected by reasoning-strength + family diversity, with
  graceful degrade. Every run **stamps which model filled which role**.

## Files in this skill

**Engine (Node — ESM `.mjs`):**
- `bin/crucible-lib.mjs` — the contract layer: re-exports the imported Foreman
  primitives, the checkpoint superset (`newCrucibleCheckpoint`), the three-stage state
  machine + HALT-gate set, and the containment-safe managed-git context.
- `bin/agent.mjs` — the live `agent()` seam (`claude -p`), env-gated by
  `CRUCIBLE_AGENT_LIVE=1`, stubbable in tests.
- `bin/shark-tank.mjs` — the adversarial round engine (Sharks, cross-Shark finding
  identity, ≥2-agree BLOCKER, inclusion-test demotion, dry-round detection).
- `bin/synthesizer.mjs` / `bin/judge.mjs` — the Director (steers, never decides; the
  fresh-eyes cold pass + isolation oracle) and the context-free deciding Judge.
- `bin/gates.mjs` — the well-formedness gate (spawns `locate-plan.mjs`), the
  quality/convergence gate, and the post-lock tiered drift detector.
- `bin/research.mjs` — researchPrime integration (once up-front + cost-guarded per round).
- `bin/stage0.mjs` / `bin/stage1.mjs` / `bin/stage2.mjs` — the three stage protocols.
- `bin/enhanced.mjs` / `bin/remote.mjs` — the CROSS-FAMILY verification seam (builds the
  live role-routed agent: Gemini Sharks/Judge, Claude steering — the 5:1 split, via the
  shared `makeRoleRoutedAgent` + gemini-cli tier ladder) + the push-at-approval-gates
  GitHub remote (never auto-pushes).
- `bin/docs.mjs` — the living-doc + version-control layer.
- `bin/self-run.mjs` — the dogfood self-run (drives Stage 0→1→2, proves convergence +
  HALT/resume, emits a zero-HALT doc-trio) — also the runnable entrypoint.
- `bin/checklist.mjs` — the 5-gate Skill Productionization Checklist (the five
  North-Star criteria, made checkable) + the SKILL.md manifest checker.

**Tests:** `test/*.test.mjs`, auto-discovered by `test/index.mjs`. The gate is
`node --test test/`.

## How to invoke — the OPERATOR RUNBOOK (2026-07-11; a live session drives THIS, never an improvised protocol)

1. **Bind the live seam.** `CRUCIBLE_AGENT_LIVE=1`; build the cross-family agent via
   `buildLiveCrucibleAgent()` (`bin/enhanced.mjs` — Gemini Sharks/Judge, Claude steering, the 5:1
   split, Gemini cap 2). Pass its ROUTES into the loop (`runMasterPlanLoop({ ..., routes })`) so the
   Judge's stamp derives from where the judge role ACTUALLY dispatches (T7) — the default same-model
   Judge persona is the agy-down fallback, not the normal path.
2. **Stage 0** → `runStage0`/protocol: complexity triage HALTs for depth confirmation; frame; candidate
   North Star. **Gate ergonomics (John's locked preferences):** present the candidate North Star
   VERBATIM IN THE MESSAGE BODY (never clipped into a dialog preview); if the user asked for research,
   DELIVER IT BEFORE the lock ask; present decisions ONE AT A TIME, each with 30-second plain-English
   context and a recommendation first.
3. **Stage 1** → `runStage1({ agent, northStar, depth, routes, artifactsDir, statusLog, ... })` —
   brainstorm → triage → phased plan → Shark loop. On the round cap it HALTs WITH the best draft +
   open findings attached and persisted (T5) — review those, never restart from zero.
4. **Stage 2** → `runStage2({ agent, northStar, masterPlan, outputDir, depth, routes, statusLog, ... })`
   — decompose → loop → approval → emit + well-formedness gate → Foreman handoff. A cap HALT emits the
   unapproved doc-trio to `<outputDir>/_unapproved-cap-draft` (gated, clearly not the handoff).
5. **Dogfood deterministically** (no model, no billing): `node bin/self-run.mjs [outputDir]`.
6. **LITE honesty note:** the user-confirmed LITE depth currently shrinks the round cap (5→2) only —
   it does NOT yet collapse stages (a small task still pays ~18-20 calls + 4 gates). The stage-merged
   LITE (≤6 calls, 2 gates) is planned, not built; do not promise it.

> **⏱ STATUS UPDATES TO CHAT — the launch pattern (2026-07-11 fix).** A Shark-Tank stage loop runs
> 20-40 min; a driving session that calls a stage FOREGROUND is frozen and CANNOT post updates — the
> silent-cadence bug. So when a session drives Crucible:
> 1. **Pass `statusLog: '<outputDir>/_crucible-status.log'`** into `runStage1`/`runStage2` — the loop
>    then writes the LOCKED Status table there at t=0, every ~10 min, and on stop (`bin/status-heartbeat.mjs`;
>    OFF when `statusLog` is omitted, so tests/dogfood stay silent). Crucible had NO emitter before this.
> 2. **Run the stage in the BACKGROUND** (Bash `run_in_background: true`), never a blocking foreground call.
> 3. **Arm the cadence at launch** (`ScheduleWakeup` ~600s or `/loop 10m`) and **each tick READ the tail
>    of `_crucible-status.log` (shell-free) and POST the latest status to chat in the LOCKED Status-table
>    format — canonical definition in ONE place: user-global `AGENTS.md` → "Long-run progress updates"
>    (`[HH:MM]` header · Effort/Doing/Status/Tests/Blocker/Procs/**Journal** rows · ETA + To do footer).
>    The **Journal** row (mandatory, `none` when empty) recaps everything journaled since the last tick —
>    the engine log is the data source; the SESSION composes the Journal row from `journal/`.**
> 4. **Stop** at the stage's user-approval HALT (the loop's `stop()` fires the final table automatically).
> The chat window is the PRIMARY channel; the log is the data source. Only a session reaches chat.

Every real run writes a `journal/runs/` training record (Skill Foundry AGENTS.md "Run capture").

## Usage journal (sleep-loop feed — append after every REAL run)

At the end of any real (non-test) run of this skill, append ONE entry to
`journal/` in this skill folder as `NNNN-<slug>.md` (next number; APPEND-ONLY —
a correction is a new entry, never an edit). Keep it under ~15 lines, honest over
polished, with the 7 canonical fields (see the Skill Foundry's
`planning/portfolio-program/src/journal.mjs`): id, skill, situation, context,
observation, outcome (worked | friction | failed | refused), provenance
(genuine-execution | seeded — only genuine-execution corroborates).
No journal entries → the sleep loop has nothing to learn from.
