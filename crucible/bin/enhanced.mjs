// enhanced.mjs — Crucible's CROSS-FAMILY verification seam (Wave W6 — RETIRED shim).
//
// HISTORY / RETIREMENT. Through Wave 9 this module was a COMPETING cross-model path: a
// hardcoded model registry whose Gemini entry was a non-current, API-style id, provisioned
// via an API-key env probe + a child-process capability spawn. That violated two
// standing rules — the no-phantom-model rule (never name an API-style / non-current id;
// `agy` silently degrades those to Flash) and the single-seam rule (one shared role
// router, never a bespoke per-module backend). It was ALSO never wired into the live
// path (only its own test imported it). Wave W6 RETIRES it: this file is now a thin shim
// over the trio's shared `makeRoleRoutedAgent` (drivers/index.mjs) + the gemini-cli tier
// ladder (`resolveGeminiModel`), building Crucible's live agent from coding/review family
// prefs (CODING_FAMILY / REVIEW_FAMILY or ~/.anchor/model_prefs.json) — verification seats
// (shark / judge) on REVIEW_FAMILY, steering / drafting (synthesizer / default) on
// CODING_FAMILY. Historical machine default remains Claude codes + Gemini checks.
//
// The model for the Gemini seats is left UNPINNED so the gemini-cli driver's TRIO_TIER
// ladder resolves it (heavy → "Gemini 3.1 Pro (High)", standard → "Gemini 3.5 Flash
// (Medium)") — NEVER an API-style id. There is no hardcoded model registry, no API-key env
// probe, and no child-process capability spawn here anymore.
//
// Reference topology (JUST-BUILT, mirrored): researchPrime/bin/live-round-agent.mjs (the
// W5 live cross-family round agent). The four load-bearing behaviors are identical:
//   1. ROLE-ROUTED AGENT via makeRoleRoutedAgent — shark/judge → gemini-cli (tier-resolved
//      model), synthesizer/default → claude. The injected-agent SEAM is preserved:
//      instrumentCrucibleAgent wraps ANY agent (a stub in tests, the live role-routed
//      agent in production), so no live call is needed to exercise tracking + the cap.
//   2. REACHED-FAMILY TRACKER — records the distinct family of every dispatch that
//      ACTUALLY returned (attested), so a run's substrate provenance is DERIVED from what
//      was reached, never a hardcoded list.
//   3. CONCURRENCY CAP — a counting semaphore bounds concurrent LIVE-GEMINI (agy)
//      dispatches to CRUCIBLE_GEMINI_MAX_CONCURRENCY (default 2, hard ceiling 3: agy OOMs
//      above ~3). Only gemini-family calls are gated; Claude dispatches run unbounded.
//   4. HONEST DEGRADE — a failed / unattested Gemini call throws (the W0 gemini-cli seam's
//      HaltError on non-attested) and is NEVER recorded as reached and NEVER retried onto
//      Claude; it propagates so the run HALTs. The routing guard additionally refuses to
//      even BUILD an agent whose verification role would resolve to the drafter family
//      (fail-closed against self-review).
//
// Stdlib + the shipped crucible/trio seams only. The trio role-routed agent is a LAZY
// dynamic import (live path only), so importing THIS module never loads the trio and never
// spawns a subprocess — the deterministic test injects a stub through instrumentCrucibleAgent.
