  'C3 The steward drives: template-contract situation brief on open (stand / running-and-doing-what / one next move / goal-guard line), compose-first directive card pushes it.',
  'C4 E1 engine-enforced: telemetry-clock injection of the status table + footer, and the turn-completion hook refusing to close on an unanswered ratified question (the ratified bound is a recorded NS amendment, F7).',
  'C5 E2 engine-enforced: died/quiet/timeout triggers the two-tier containment-checked worktree sweep (F4: symlink-resolved, worktree/project containment, unclaimed listed never executed) whose card must be BOUND into the queue before any re-commission can enqueue.',
  'C6 E3 engine-enforced: resumed/re-briefed rewrites diff against the triaged correction ledger with positive containment assertions; a regression blocks the handback with a named finding; unassertable entries honestly demoted in every report.',
  'C7 Prose gates serialized with preference preload and mid-flight re-brief (mode fixed by the Phase-0 inbox audit; boundary-mode honesty drawn into the confirm card).',
  'C8 The ease metric live from the first input-taking surface with the pre-registered classifier; campaign-close report compares against the Stage-2 baseline (5->0) and requires John\'s audit. Auth-ON everywhere; state-changing surfaces get the F6 CSRF-class assertion set.',
  'MOCKUP KILL GATE: DOM/class structure diffs mechanically against mockups.html M1/overlays/deliv in CI; deviations only via the Phase-0 batched mockup-amendment gate.',
  'SECURITY FOLDS: F3 deliverable-action execution bounds (containment, pinned cwd, list-argv, verb allow-list) and F5 hostile-string DOM suite are wave-level acceptance tests, not notes.',
  'NON-GOALS (restate in every wave): no engine-spine changes; no UI beyond the amended locked mockup; no High Seat work; no new commission lanes; tiles retired only on signed rail+STATUS parity.',
  'BUILD-vs-WIRE honesty from the plan: run_pulse/step_detail/step_note/status_flip/compose-first/reflection/findings/live-line/paced-PTY/auto-commit exist — wire and re-home; deterministic-first render, manifest+edges+deliverable schema, ETA medians, E1 turn gate, E2 sweep, E3 diff, ease counter, M1 render + overlays, tile retirement are NEW code.',
