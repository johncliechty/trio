# Foreman

**One sentence:** A multi-wave build orchestrator that executes a frozen plan wave by wave, runs real tests itself, and stops when the plan is unclear — never invents scope.

## Use this when
- You have an approved, wave-structured implementation plan (often from Crucible)
- You want autonomous build progress with gates, reviews, and a clean tree
- You need “done” defined by real tests, not by a model saying it’s done

## Do not use this when
- There is no frozen plan yet (use Crucible first)
- You’re still exploring what to build
- You need research or deep critique rather than code execution

## What you get
- Wave-by-wave execution: implement → test gate → adversarial review → fix → re-check
- Orchestrator-run tests (agents can’t fake the pass/fail)
- Auto-advance across waves; halt only on real blockers for you
- Resume from checkpoint after a stop

## What it is not
- Not a planner — it will not invent requirements or “improve” architecture for taste
- Not a silent scope-creeper; ambiguity is a stop, not a guess
- Not a green light for empty work (vacuous “pass” when tests prove nothing is refused)

## How to start (human)
1. Put description, implementation plan (with `## Wave N` sections), and test command in the project.
2. Confirm the contract Foreman reads back before build starts.
3. Launch the run and watch status updates; act only when it halts for you.
4. On halt, fix the named issue (or approve a plan amendment) and resume.

## Limits (honest)
- No parseable waves or no test command → it will not start
- Builds take real wall-clock time; budget caps apply
- It builds what’s in the frozen plan — not what you hoped was implied
