There is NO parked/Not-now event (cut): walking away IS the open draft.',
  'EVIDENCE TAGS (A4 as cut): each North-Star criterion is tagged hermetic / live-seat / John\'s screen INSIDE the one completion journal (no separate table artifact); the ONE live Codex recording is a named wave step already authorized by John\'s 2026-09-01 approval — no further HALT-for-go; replayed hermetically after.',
