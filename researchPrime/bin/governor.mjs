// bin/governor.mjs — Wave 8 GOVERNOR WIRING + INCLUSION-TEST ENFORCEMENT (Phase D).
//
// MASTER-PLAN Phase D / IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN Wave 8 done-when: a LOW-stakes run fires ZERO
// Synthesizer/Judge/debate sub-agents (call-count 0 via the Wave-7 spy seam) AND a HIGH-stakes run
// fires call-count > 0 (positive control); a zero-AXIS-finding round is provably skipped/demoted.
//
// This module is the WIRING that the prior waves were built to drop into — it forks NOTHING:
//   - the stakes → governor tier comes from the Wave-4 adjudicated stakes vector (bin/stakes.mjs);
//   - the round's adjudication layer (G4 Judge · active Synthesizer · G9 debate) and its call-count
//     SPY SEAM come from the Wave-7 round orchestration (bin/round.mjs `orchestrateRound`);
//   - the INCLUSION TEST (a finding that does not trace to the North Star / AXIS is DEMOTED and
//     cannot hold the loop open) is the trio's own, reused through `tallyFindings` (bin/round.mjs →
//     crucible/shark-tank.mjs). A round whose every finding is demoted serves the AXIS not at all,
//     so it is the "zero-AXIS-finding round" the governor skips.
//
// Two honesty levers meet here, both straight from the locked North Star ("All scaled by the
// declared AXIS stakes" · "No element survives that doesn't serve the AXIS"):
//
//   (1) STAKES SCALING (crit-2/crit-4 cost discipline). The persistent ACTIVE Deep-Think Synthesizer
//       is a "medium+" instrument (MASTER-PLAN North Star) and the separate Judge + conditional
//       debate ride with it. At tier `low` the governor EXCLUDES all three, so a low-stakes run pays
//       zero high-tier sub-agent cost; at `medium`/`high` it INCLUDES them. The tier itself is the
//       Wave-4 ADJUDICATED value (irreversible ⇒ ≥ medium, I6) — never the author's casual word — so
//       the inclusion decision cannot be gamed down by under-declaring stakes.
//
//   (2) INCLUSION-TEST ENFORCEMENT (crit-4 "zero-AXIS-finding rounds skipped"). Independently of the
//       stakes tier, a round that surfaced NO finding tracing to the AXIS is SKIPPED — its expensive
//       adjudication never runs, because there is nothing AXIS-serving to adjudicate. This is the
//       load-bearing demotion: even a HIGH-stakes round is skipped when its findings are all
//       out-of-scope, so stakes can raise the ceiling but cannot manufacture work the AXIS doesn't
//       justify.
//
// PURITY: `governorPolicy`, `resolveTier`, and the AXIS predicates are deterministic, side-effect
// free functions of their inputs. `runGovernedRound` decides the skip from the PURE trio tally
// BEFORE any sub-agent fires, so a skipped round provably makes zero high-tier agent calls.

 *   2. Compute the trio tally from the reviews — this is PURE (no sub-agent calls), so the skip
 *      decision is made BEFORE any high-tier agent could fire.

 *      demotion stamp without invoking the adjudication layer at all (crit-4). This holds at EVERY
 *      tier, so even a high-stakes round is skipped when nothing serves the AXIS.
 *   4. Otherwise delegate to `orchestrateRound` with the tier's inclusion flags. At tier `low` all
 *      three flags are false ⇒ the spy seam reports {0,0,0}; at `medium`/`high` they are true ⇒ the
 *      Synthesizer + Judge fire (and debate fires iff there is a cross-origin conflict), so the spy
