const criteria = [
  '1. Spoken description → PROPOSED multi-stage scaffolding (coarse steps + Oranges annotations), batch-confirmed; zero chat turns persisted.',
  '2. Scaffolding authoring LIGHTWEIGHT: one confirmed session ENVELOPE covers compiles AND orchestrator-loop reflections (each shown; exhaustion hard-stops). No per-sentence confirmation dialog.',
  '3. Commission proposed FOR a named stage showing skill + seat + depth before spend; nothing runs until John confirms; confirmation records who.',
  '4. On validated handback: REFLECTION RECEIPT with Oranges prompts + PROPOSE next stage through propose→confirm. Unattended handback: queue reflection; compile at next session open (no unattended spend — Stage-1 Decision 1).',
  '5. PROGRESSIVE ELABORATION: starting a stage triggers targeted questions or offered researchPrime commission — never demanded at scaffold time.',
  '6. One campaign exercises AT LEAST TWO different commissioned skills.',
  '7. Stage artifacts render reviewably; spoken correction → new version through propose→confirm.',
  '8. Roadmap status reflects ACTUAL session state across park, restart, kill.',
  '9. All of it passes with AUTH ON, asserted on outcomes rather than plumbing.',
  '10. roadmap_events has exactly ONE writer, proven by a concurrency test.',
  '11. CONTINUITY: full restart with every context gone → first message states campaign state from ledger only; no re-ask; dead run + missing handback NAMED.',
  '12. ALTITUDE CONTRACT: typed attention projection (working|needs_you|deliverable_ready|blocked|idle) from one pure read-only function; High Seat fold write_authority none; badge within one poll; zero ambient beyond badge.',
  '13. PORTFOLIO AT A GLANCE from EXISTING portfolio index (no root walk); unreadable → unknown row, never silently shorter list. Consume index — do NOT re-plan/rebuild (A5 Wave-1 audit; Stage-1 Decision 2).',
  'GATE DECISIONS: (1) unattended reflections queue; (2) A5 audit not re-plan; (3) briefCacheStale FIXED in Wave 1 / Phase 1 under named-fix diff fence.',
  'NON-GOALS: no portfolio-index rebuild; no High Seat WRITE; no Crucible/Foreman/researchPrime internals; no adversarial review in product loop; no unattended spend; refuted e-1/e-4 stay dead.',
  'BUILD-vs-WIRE: Ecgberht propose/confirm/bind, packet-view, receipt-validate, brief.assembleBriefPacket, high-seat, rank, engine/portfolio/* are BUILT — wire/audit/fix. MISSING: Anchor commission executor (.py), dialogue→step_create, attention emitters, deliverable_ready state, chamber UI steps/proposal/confirm/artifact.',
