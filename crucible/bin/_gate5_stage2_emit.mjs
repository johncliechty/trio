// Gate 5 — Stage 2 approval + emit (2026-09-01). Stage 2 HALTed human-lockable at 10:40 with the
// doc trio NOT yet emitted (the engine emits only after approval). John delegated this gate
// ("I run Stage 2 → Foreman → canary and return only for your restart"). The reviewers' agreed
// points were folded by hand into wave-decomposition-approved.json (see IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN-
// AMENDMENTS.md); this script renders the trio through the engine's own renderer, runs the
// machine well-formedness gate, and records the approval. No model call.

  'EXPOSURE (A2 as cut): kickoff-show = cockpit GET /api/ecgberht/kickoff_show?pid=&effort= ONLY (resolved through the existing _effort_dir guard); kickoff-confirm and kickoff-replay are conversational/bridge-CLI, proven by hermetic bridge-CLI tests; the routes inventory states that truthfully (zero not_exposed on kickoff verbs).',

No parked/Not-now event: walking away IS the open draft.',
  'EVIDENCE TAGS (A4): each North-Star criterion is tagged hermetic / live-seat / John\'s screen inside the ONE completion journal; the single live Codex recording is authorized by John\'s 2026-09-01 approval (no further HALT-for-go) and carries its own failure-state rows (seat unavailable / slow-or-killed / garbage reply; one retry; on failure the wave HALTs naming the row — never a fabricated tape).',

  'GATES RIDE WITH THEIR PHASE (A6) + OBLIGATIONS ARE TESTS: every hardening-gate obligation maps to a NAMED test id in its wave\'s test file (the printed checklist is not the gate); the execution-leak sentinel (seam spies on commission/draft/model-run/specialist + a tree-snapshot diff) is ONE mechanism reused by every no-execution assertion.',
  'SEMANTICS (A7/A8/A10): envelope = no write before confirm, materialized in the confirm receipt; the Face FILE is written at confirmation and is a pure re-derivation of the receipt (a cache, never a source of truth; double-confirm rewrites it byte-identically); question cap = the North Star\'s ≤1 per turn, with the fixture bar "sparse fixtures reach a (thin) proposal by turn 2 — a thin bundle, not a third question, is the answer to ambiguity"; v0 re-proposal on component/integration change only; no path mutates a proposal in place; one completion journal, id at write time.',
  'GROUND TRUTH REACHES BOTH REPOS: the single gate is node scripts/run-all-tests.mjs in Ecgberht; every Anchor-side wave declares its pytest paths in scripts/wave-manifests.mjs (auth-on lane pytest bridge) so the orchestrator-run gate actually executes them — a wave whose tests the gate cannot reach is not green.',
