  "Roadmap, proposes a commission for a named roadmap step, and - only on John's explicit confirmation - " +
  "Anchor executes it as a real trio run. The produced plan comes back as an artifact John can read on " +
  "screen and change by talking; when he says start, Foreman executes and the Roadmap shows the truth " +
  "about what is running. Nothing is spent, written, or started without a human confirmation, and the " +
  "campaign ledger remains the single source of truth. NON-GOALS: portfolio altitude (High Seat " +
  "cross-project reporting, pause, resource conflicts) is deferred; no changes to Crucible/Foreman/" +
  "researchPrime themselves; no bespoke plan template (the Crucible plan shape IS the template); no " +

  "Fresh start: from a project with no Face, no Strip and no roadmap, a spoken description produces a Face north-star AND at least one roadmap step, with ZERO chat turns persisted (E5: Strip receipts + roadmap events + Face narrative are the sole durable ledger; the dialogue COMPILES into the Face via refine_goal -> face_rewrite_receipt).",
  "Propose/confirm: a commission is proposed FOR a named roadmap step (never free-floating), showing skill + seat + depth BEFORE any spend; nothing runs until John confirms, and the confirmation records `who`. Engine halves already exist: job-lifecycle.mjs proposeCommission (141) / confirmCommission (250).",
  "Real execution + validated handback: Anchor executes the confirmed commission as a real trio run (job_runner.py / terminal_session.py / lanes.py substrate) and returns a handback validated by receipt-validate.mjs (required: active_effort, why_next, grasscatch_why, tool_depth_why, human_wait, uncertainty_flags); a malformed handback is REFUSED, never absorbed.",
  "Reviewable artifact + spoken refine: the produced plan renders as an artifact card (packet-view.mjs classifyArtifact/buildArtifactCard already exists) and a spoken correction produces a new version through the SAME propose -> confirm path.",
  "Honest status: the Roadmap step status reflects the ACTUAL state of the Anchor session across park (STATUS_IDLE), restart and kill - it never reports work that is not running. Status flows as status_flip events; the projection derives.",
  "Auth-ON proof: every criterion above passes with ANCHOR_TOKEN set, asserted on OUTCOMES not plumbing. This surface shipped broken twice in one week because effectively the whole Anchor suite runs auth-off.",
  "Single writer, proven: roadmap_events has exactly ONE writer, proven by a concurrency test (hardening law: a durability claim is a STORAGE claim - name atomic write + lock/serialization + a concurrency test), not by prose. Anchor must not become a second writer.",
];

const acceptanceCriteria = [
  "WAVE-0 KILL GATE: a step_create event minted from the scoping dialogue (compiled into the Face, NOT stored as chat) + propose + confirm(who) + Anchor executes + status_flip returns + artifact renders, on a FRESH project, with auth ON. If this round-trip cannot be made to work, the capability is blocked at the front door and every later wave is void.",
  "BUILD-vs-WIRE ledger must be honoured: ALREADY BUILT (wiring only) = proposeCommission/confirmCommission + commission_bind through the single writer, classifyArtifact/buildArtifactCard, receipt-validate, roadmap projection, confirmStandUp Face/Strip creation, write-authority. NOT BUILT (real new code) = a dialogue->step_create path (step_create is minted in exactly ONE place today, pe-gate.mjs:444, for PARKED future steps), the Anchor commission executor (grep -rni commission over every Anchor .py returns NOTHING), status_flip emission, and chamber UI for steps/proposal/confirm/artifact.",
  "REFUTED - do NOT resurrect: (e-1) adding an artifact channel to the handback envelope - artifact machinery already exists in packet-view.mjs; (e-4) bind-the-step-and-derive-status as new work - confirmCommission already appends commission_bind with the projection deriving.",
  "Seat safety: cross the family/driver boundary through resolveSeats. Anchor's default_cli is the bare string 'grok'; family grok maps to driver grok-cli, and a bare 'grok' DRIVER is refused by isProductionSeatSafe. Assert the mapping for every default_cli value Anchor can emit.",
